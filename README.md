## Frontend for an Invoice App.

This web app was done using the MERN Stack. The task was created by (https://frontendmentor.io), and developers were given the freedom to use any technology to complete the task.

The original task is meant for users to create, updated, delete, and mark an invoice as paid. I made the app full-stack and added other functionalities.

- Added authentication functionalities:

  - Registration of users.
  - Password reset functionality.

- Users will only see invoices that were created by them.

- Users will be able to filter between Paid, Pending, and Draft invoices

- Users will be able to switch theme (Light and Dark Theme)

- Users will be able to edit invoices.

- Users will be able to delete invoices.

- And users will be able to mark an invoice as paid.
